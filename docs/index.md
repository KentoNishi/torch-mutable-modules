## What is `torch-mutable-modules`?

*Pitch-shift audio clips quickly with PyTorch (CUDA supported)! Additional utilities for searching efficient transformations are included.*

This package includes two main features:

* Pitch-shift audio clips quickly using PyTorch (with CUDA support)
* Calculate efficient pitch-shift targets (useful for augmentation, where speed is more important than precise pitch-shifts)
